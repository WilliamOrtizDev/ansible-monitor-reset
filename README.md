Playbook seems a bit useless since its only meant to fix a single machine at a time, which could simply be fixed by connecting to it via SSH and edit the monitor conf. It was originally created to decrease the ability for remote Tier-1 techs to screw it up, and was accessible to them via a commandline alias. Nonetheless I figured someone out there may find pieces of this useful.
